# SMU O'Donnell Data Science and Research Computing Institute Distributed Python Workshop

The SMU [Oâ€™Donnell Data Science and Research Computing
Institute](https://www.smu.edu/provost/odonnell-institute) Distributed Python
workshop is designed for researchers seeking to optimize their workflows for
large-scale data processing and parallel computing. Participants will explore
the fundamentals of distributed computing with Python, learning how to leverage
Dask for efficient task parallelism and Ray for scalable machine learning and
reinforcement learning applications. Through hands-on exercises, attendees will
gain practical experience in deploying these tools to handle massive datasets,
optimize computational resources, and streamline workflows.
