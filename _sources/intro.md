# Overview

Welcome to the SMU [O’Donnell Data Science and Research Computing
Institute](https://www.smu.edu/provost/odonnell-institute) (ODSRCI) workshop on
PyTorch Geometric (PyG), a powerful library for deep learning on graphs and
irregular structures. PyG extends PyTorch with optimized data structures and
operations tailored for graph-based learning, enabling efficient implementation
of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this session, we will explore PyG’s core
functionalities, including data handling, message passing, and model building
for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph
classification. Whether you’re new to graph-based deep learning or looking to
enhance your PyTorch expertise, this workshop will provide hands-on guidance and
practical applications to help you leverage PyG effectively.
